I wanted to be engaged with all the tech events happening in Bengaluru. I have not attended any major tech conference even though I have lived here for more than 3 years now.
For this year, I have registered for [India FOSS](https://fossunited.org/indiafoss/2025) (which I missed last time as I was trekking in Kashmir) & [PyCon](https://in.pycon.org/2025/).
