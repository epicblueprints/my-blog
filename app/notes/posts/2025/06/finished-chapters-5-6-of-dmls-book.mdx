Completed reading Chapter 6 (Model Development) & Chapter 5 (Feature Engineering) of DMLS book.

Chapter 5: Feature Engineering
- Learned vs Engineered Features: Deep learning models can learn features automatically
- Feature Engineering Operations: Handling missing feature values (very interesting examples), scaling, discretization, encoding categorical features (with the hashing trick)
feature crossing, etc
- Data Leakage: How can data leakage lead to optimistic evaluation numbers that fails in production env (ex., pre-computation across training and testing set)

Chapter 6: Model Development & Offline evaluation
- Model Selection: Start with simple models and then evaluate tradeoffs (performance, latency, cost, interpretability)
- Ensembles (Dominates most Kaggle competitions): Bagging, Boosting & Stacking
- Debugging ML models example: Try to overfit a single batch of data to ensure that the model is capable of learning
- Evaluations: Keep baseline to compare with, have different slice-level evaluation (simpson's paradox), perform perturbation & invariance tests
- Four Phases of ML Development: Before ML, Simplest ML models, Optimizing ML, Complex models

*Note* - Gemini-CLI helped in recollecting the chapters.
