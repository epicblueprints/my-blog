I'm enjoying reading [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://github.com/chiphuyen/dmls-book) book by [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/).

I plan to read this book a bit out of order as I am not new to this subject. I will pick chapters in the order of my interest.

I am finding this book a great starting point for building expertise in ML systems.
