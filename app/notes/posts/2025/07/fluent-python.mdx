After finishing [DMLS](https://github.com/chiphuyen/dmls-book) last month, I am continuing the tradition by bringing a new book to my desk.
This one’s famous for helping people get really good at Python.

I started using Python for all my personal projects, and the benefits are easy to see.
It’s much more fun to write in this language, and there’s so much to learn.
