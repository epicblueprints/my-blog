Started tinkering with hacking challenges on OverTheWire.

I have stumbled upon OTW multiple times but never managed to solve beyond 2-3 challenges.
Hoping this would remain as a good hobby that I keep myself binded to.
I am starting with [Leviathan](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/) game that is beginner friendly.
