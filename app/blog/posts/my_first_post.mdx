## Hello World: My First Post

I've finally started my blog! While this might be a simple start, I'm committing to a weekly writing schedule. The goal is to share interesting discoveries, technical insights, and my adventures in making things work (and look good).

I've been particularly inspired by [Simon Willison's approach to blogging](https://simonwillison.net/), especially his dedication to consistent documentation and sharing. Like Simon, I plan to maintain a "Today I Learned" (TIL) section where I'll document small but useful discoveries, code snippets, and quick tips.

What to expect:
- Weekly posts about technology, design, and development
- TIL entries for bite-sized learning
- Clear, aesthetically pleasing content (because good information deserves good presentation)

Here's to consistent writing and sharing what I learn along the way!
